# Periodic Chaos

## Game Instructions

This is a card game with 54 cards (48 element cards, 4 FLIP cards, and 2 uranium cards). The game is played by dealing an equal size hand to each player and taking turns playing cards until one person has no cards left. That person is the winner and the master of the periodic table.
Hence, the object of the game is to get rid of all your cards first.

The element cards are ranked in a hierarchy based on their strength number. A higher strength number correlates to a “stronger card.” At the beginning, _the strength number of each element card is the same as its atomic number_.

The game progresses as follows: choose a person to go first. That person must place an element card on the table, starting a stack. Then, in a clockwise order around the table, each player may choose to either place a card on top of the stack or forfeit their turn. Each card in the stack must have a higher strength number than the previous card in the stack. If, at any point, all players decide to pass their turn, discard the stack. Then, the person who placed the last card may place any card to start a new stack, and play continues.

Note: you may also play two of the same card (two-of-a-kind) to start a stack; in this case, all subsequent plays must also be two-of-a-kind cards with higher strength.
There are two special cards: uranium cards and FLIP cards. Uranium cards are nuclear bombs; they have a strength number of infinity and can beat any other card.

FLIP cards are unique in that they can be played at any time, even if it is not your turn. Playing a FLIP card does not count as taking a turn. FLIP cards are placed straight into the discard pile, not on the playing stack. A FLIP card allows you to reassign the strength numbers of **all the element cards in the game (other than uranium)** to either **atomic number, electronegativity, or atomic radius**.

Finally, there are certain special combinations you may use. If you have a carbon and a nitrogen, you may play both as a cyanide at any time, and thus skip the current player’s turn. This may also be used with two chlorides.
WHILE you have three-of-a-kind, you have a monopoly on that element. Multiply the strength number of those cards by 1.5.

Good luck and have fun!
